Hi everyone, here is some of my work during my 3 years of high-school.

The majority of them are in Portuguese, so I would recommend using a translator if you want to use them

Some these I did with my friends, they were group projects, these projects are simple.

Sorry if some of them dont work, I didnt change them since I made them, so that i could see a evolution.

I hope you enjoy and just like myself, you could take on this fantastic adventure that programing is, and learn with fantastic people that are out there.

Keep learning.
